Computes difference between mean of coefficients and dependent variable
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	syntax anything

Description
-----------

^center_estimates^ computes the difference between (i) the weighted mean of coefficients of levels 
of a factor variable and (ii) the mean of the dependent variable from the relevant sample. The 
factor variable is specified via ^anything^ using factor notation, and must enter estimation results
using the same notation.

Coefficients in (i) are weighted by the corresponding number of observations in the data. The 
"relevant sample" for the mean in (ii) are observations that correspond to specified levels of the 
factor variable in ^anything^ (for example, the regression may use i.group but you might want to 
only center coefficients i(1 3).group).

If estimates include a base level, but ^anything^ does not, then you must add the "bn" modifier to 
indicate this (i.e., if 1 is the base level, then you must use i(2 3)bn.group instead of i(2 3).group).

Examples
--------

. ^reg y x i.group^
. ^center_estimates i.group^
. ^center_estimates i(1 3).group^
. ^center_estimates i(2 3)bn.group^
. ^center_estimates i2bn.group i3bn.group^

Stored results

^r(weighted_b_mean)^    weighted mean of coefficients
^r(diff_to_mean)^       ^r(target_mean)^ - ^(weighted_b_mean)^
