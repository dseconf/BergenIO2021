Compare two datasets
--------------------

	^cf2^ varlist ^using^ filename [^,^ ^v^erbose ^id(^varname^)^]


Description
-----------

^cf2^ is a slight variation of ^cf^ to list the observations where differences 
exist.  Option ^verbose^ must be specified to obtain the listing.  Like ^cf^,
^cf2^ compares variables in the dataset in memory (the 'master' data) to the 
corresponding variables in a file (the 'using' dataset).  The variables to be
compared are specified in varlist.  Alternatively, ^_all^ may be specified to
request that all variables be compared.  ^cf2^ returns 0 if the specified 
variables are identical and 9 if there are any differences.  Only the variable 
values are compared.  Variable labels, value labels, notes, characteristics, 
etc. are not compared.

In the listings, variable names given for the 'using' dataset are a slight 
modification of the actual variable names.  If necessary, they are truncated 
to 7 characters, and all are preceded by an underscore character.


Options
-------

^verbose^ reports the result of the comparison variable-by-variable and
    lists the observations where differences exist.  If not specified, only
    the number of differences are mentioned.

^id(^varname^)^ specifies the record id variable within the master dataset.  
    If specified, this id is displayed as part of the ^verbose^ output.
