{title:Capture the stdout of an OS command into stata variables}

        {cmd:ashell     OS_Command} 


{title:Description}

{cmd:ashell} is to be thought of as "another shell" or as "alternative" 
or "additional" shell.  If you were at some point frustrated to find 
out that there is no way to capture the output of an OS command (one 
you submit by using stata's {cmd:shell} command) into a stata variable 
so that you can reformat it and reuse it or parts of it later then this 
is the module that solves your problem. 
It kind of adds to stata's shell command a feature like perl's backticks 
where you write something like "array = `os_command`" and your array 
contains the output of os_command.

You use {cmd:ashell} like {cmd:shell} (or instead of it) when you need 
to reuse the output (or parts thereof) of the command. For example 
{cmd:shell ps -ef | wc -l} would count the running processes on your 
system. If you need the number later in your program do {cmd:ashell 
ps -ef | wc -l} instead and capture the output into stata's {cmd:r(o1)}. 

More generally if a system command returns x lines of output 
ashell will place the number of lines into r(no) and the lines 
of the output itlself into {cmd:r(o1), r(o2), ... , r(ox)}.
You can then parse them with stata's regex engine and collect 
the info you need to keep.

{cmd:ashell}
While writing the module I kept on banging against stata's 
unusual datatypes. The simplest thing to have done is to 
return the entire output of a system command into one string
and then parse it with a "match and replace regex loop" to 
collect what you need. This is impossible for many reasons not 
least of which is str244 (see {helpb datatypes}). 
The current implementation is like swishing an arrow through 
12 ax-heads.


{title:Examples}

On a Windows machine doing:

 . {cmd:ashell "date /T"}

should put the current date in {cmd:r(o1)}.

On a Solaris machine doing:
 
 . {cmd:ashell "top -b"}

should return {cmd:r(o4)} equal to somehing like:

 {cmd:Memory: 512M real, 267M free, 104M swap in use, 750M swap free}

To get the amount of free memory you would then need a snippet like this:

. {cmd:local memline = r(o4)}
. {cmd:local m = regexm("`memline'", "[0-9]+[A-Z] swap free")}

Now {cmd:m} is 1 if there was a match and the match is in {cmd:regexr(0)}. 
So doing:

. {cmd:local match = regexr(0)}

puts "750M swap free" into {cmd:match}. Finally doing: 

. {cmd:local free = regexr("`match'", " swap free", "")}

results in {cmd:free} being equal to: {cmd:750M}.



Similarly on a MacOS X machine doing

 . {cmd:ashell top -l1 -n1 | grep PhysMem}

should return {cmd:r(o1)} looking something like this:

 {cmd:PhysMem:  70.6M wired,  108M active,  145M inactive,  324M used,  699M free}


Doing 

. {cmd:ashell date} or 
. {cmd:ashell date +%Y%m%d}  

sets r(o1) to the date in the form {cmd:Tue Apr 10 07:11:19 CEST 2007} 
or {cmd:YYYYMMDD} respectively.
