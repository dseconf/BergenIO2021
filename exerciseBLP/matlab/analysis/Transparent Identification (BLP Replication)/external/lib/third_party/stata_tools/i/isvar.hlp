{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}
{cmd:isvar} takes a list of names that might name variables in
your dataset and filters it into a list of those names that are indeed 
variable names and a list of the others. 

{p 4 4 2} 
One application of {cmd:isvar} arises when you are moving between similar
datasets, especially if they are large, but are not sure which variables are
defined in which dataset. Commands such as {help describe} would fail at the
first name not in fact a variable name. {cmd:isvar} offers a more direct way to
establish existence or non-existence of several possible variables.
