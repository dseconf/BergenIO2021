{title:Description}

{pstd}
The {cmd:sjlatex} command reports on the current release of the package of
LaTeX files developed for the Stata Journal and installs/updates this
package.

{phang}
{cmd:sjlatex} reports on the LaTeX files installed in {it:dirname}.

{phang}
{cmd:sjlatex {cmd:query}} reports on the LaTeX files installed in
{it:dirname} and displays the release number of the files at the
Stata Journal website.

{phang}
{cmd:sjlatex install} installs the LaTeX files in {it:dirname}.

{phang}
{cmd:sjlatex update} updates the LaTeX files in {it:dirname}.

{phang}
{cmd:sjlatex ado} updates {cmd:sjlatex} and the other ado files that are
packaged with {cmd:sjlatex}.  This subcommand is only necessary for Stata 8 or
older; otherwise, use the {help adoupdate} command released in Stata 9.


{title:Options}

{phang}
{cmd:using} {it:dirname} identifies a directory to be used in
{cmd:sjlatex} [ {cmd:query} | {cmd:install} | {cmd:update} ].
{cmd:sjlatex install} creates {it:dirname}.  The default is to use the
current directory.

{phang}
{cmd:replace} ({cmd:sjlatex} {cmd:install} only) causes {cmd:sjlatex}
{cmd:install} to behave like {cmd:sjlatex update}.

{title:Getting Started with the Stata Journal}

{pstd}
There is a getting started example packaged with the Stata Journal LaTeX
files. The driver (main.tex) for this example uses the Stata Press document
class (statapress.cls), the Stata Press page dimensions package
(pagedims.sty), the Stata Journal package (sj.sty), the Stata
package (stata.sty), and the Stata Journal bibliographic style
(sj.bst). Individuals that have access to recent distributions of TeX are
encouraged to use these files since they are ultimately used to generate the
Stata Journal in its printed and electronic forms.

{pstd}
An alternate driver (altmain.tex) is also supplied. This file uses the LaTeX2e
standard article document class along with sj.bst, sj.sty, and
stata.sty.  This alternative driver is supplied with the hope that
compatibility will not be an issue; however, the page dimensions and font
sizes are different in this case.


{title:File Dependencies}

{pstd}
The Stata Press document class (statapress.cls) is based on the standard
book document class (book.cls) in your TeX distribution.

{phang}
statapress.cls also requires hyperref.sty, color.sty,
fancyhdr.sty, natbib.sty, makeidx.sty, showidx.sty, and
multind.sty.

{phang}
pagedims.sty requires calc.sty and calc.sty.

{phang}
sj.sty requires ifthen.sty and chapterbib.sty.

{phang}
stata.sty requires alltt.sty and pstricks.sty.

{pstd}
All of these packages are available in most "free" TeX distributions.

{pmore}
Unfortunately crop.sty, chapterbib.sty, and natbib.sty are not
present in OzTeX 4.0, but they are collected into the
{net search sjextra:sjextra} Stata package for download.  If you are using
OzTeX, then you will have to copy these files into the directory containing
your journal insert.  The docstrip documentation/source for crop.sty and
natbib.sty are also included in the sjextra package for copyright
purposes.  This package can be found using the following command in Stata.

{pmore2}
{cmd:. net search} {net search sjextra:sjextra}

{pmore}
You must also change {cmd:newcenter} to {cmd:oldcenter} in main.tex.


{title:Running LaTeX}

{pstd}
Before you make any changes to main.tex (or altmain.tex) to include your
journal insert, you should test the files using the given example article
(readme.tex).  In fact, the files are already set up to perform the test.  In
the following, we assume that you will be using main.tex, but the instructions
are essentially the same if you use altmain.tex.

{pstd}
The LaTeX program on Unix machines and PCs is invoked at the command prompt,
so let {cmd:>} (greater than symbol) be the command prompt.  The Stata prompt
is {cmd:.} (period).  Macintosh distributions of TeX tend to be based on
menus, thus the spirit of the following instructions are equivalent.

{phang}
1.  Install {cmd:sjlatex}.  Then from within Stata, install the author tools
in a new directory.  For example, you might try one of the following depending
upon your operating system.

{pmore}
PC Windows:{break}
{cmd:. sjlatex install using C:\sjtemp}

{pmore}
UNIX:{break}
{cmd:. sjlatex install using ~/sjtemp}

{pmore}
Macintosh:{break}
{cmd:. sjlatex install using ~:sjtemp}

{pmore}
Here {cmd:sjlatex} will indicated the version and date of the LaTeX files.

{phang}
2.  At the command prompt, you can now run LaTeX on main.tex.

{pmore}
{inp:> latex main}{break}
{inp:> bibtex main}{break}
{inp:> latex main}{break}
{inp:> latex main}{break}
{inp:> dvips main.dvi -o main.ps}

{pmore}
The first command generates the auxiliary (aux) file for your journal insert.
The bibtex command uses the aux file from your journal insert (main.aux for
the example) to generate bibliographic citations and references. After bibtex,
two more latex runs are needed to ensure that cross references appear
correctly in the resulting dvi-file.  The last command uses dvips to generate
a PostScript file from the dvi-file.

{pmore}
The above commands were placed in a script (included with the files downloaded
by {cmd:sjlatex}) for your convenience.

{pmore}
PC Windows:{break}
{inp:> doit.bat}

{pmore}
UNIX:{break}
{inp:> sh doit.sh}

{pstd}
The final result is main.ps, which can be viewed using Ghostscript (PC:
gsview, UNIX: ghostview or gv, Macintosh: view the dvi-file from the menu).
Provided your TeX distribution contains the required packages, and passed the
above test, you can use these files to write your journal insert.  Just make a
change to main.tex so that it includes the file containing your journal insert
(instead of readme.tex), and you're ready to run LaTeX on main.tex.


{title:Downloading Examples}

{pstd}
The results of the above test (of main.tex and altmain.tex) have been
converted to PDF documents collected in the {net search sjxmpl:sjxmpl} Stata
package for download.  This package can be found using the following command
in Stata.

{pmore}
{cmd:. net search} {net search sjxmpl:sjxmpl}


{title:TeX distributions}

{pstd}
The examples have been successfully tested using the following TeX
distributions.

{pmore}
PC Windows:  {browse "http://www.miktex.org":MiKTeX} version 2.3 (Free)

{pmore}
UNIX:  {browse "http://www.tug.org/tetex/":teTeX} versions 1.0 to 3.0 (Free)

{pmore}
Macintosh: {browse "http://www.trevorrow.com/oztex/":OzTeX} version 4.0
(Shareware), and {browse "http://www.kiffe.com/cmactex.html":CMacTeX}
version 4.0 (Shareware)

{pmore}
Macintosh OS X: 
{browse "http://www.uoregon.edu/~koch/texshop/texshop.html":TeXShop} 
version 1.40 (Free){p_end}
{pmore2}For compatibility with {cmd:sjlatex} and TeXShop, you must
           enable the {hi:Typeset} -> {hi:TeX} and {hi:Ghostscript} mode.

{pstd}
The main website for the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN) is
